##Outcomes

Outcomes show WHAT, HOW we do that, HOW we validate, and WHY we are doing it (the next step?)


- Addition
    - We should see these on the screen: two inputs, a plus sign, and a button
        - Why inputs?
        - Why button? 
        - Validation: look at screen
    1) WHAT: Grab the dom elements (input boxes and buttons)
        - HOW: Make variables for each dom element, using getElementById
        - Validation: console.log the DOM elements
    2) Add event listener to button
        - Validation: console.log something on click
    3) Get access to what user typed in
        - How: get the .value property of the input element
        - Validation: console.log the user input on click
    4) Use input to calculate result
        - Validation: log out result to console
    5) Display result to user
        - We need to grab a secret box and input total into it
        - Validation: total shows on screen
